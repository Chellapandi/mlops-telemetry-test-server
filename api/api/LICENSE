THE SOLUTION WILL BE AS SET FORTH IN A PURCHASE ORDER OR QUOTE EXECUTED BY THE PARTIES, OR AS SET FORTH IN ANY H2O-PROVIDED ONLINE REGISTRATION OR PURCHASE PROCESS (ALL OF THE FOREGOING, REFERRED TO HEREIN AS “ORDER DOCUMENT”.)  BY ACCESS OR USING THE SOLUTION, YOU AND THE ENTITY OR COMPANY THAT YOU REPRESENT (COLLECTIVELY, "USER") IS UNCONDITIONALLY CONSENTING TO BE BOUND BY AND IS BECOMING A PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT (“AGREEMENT”) WITH H2O. IF THESE TERMS ARE CONSIDERED AN OFFER, ACCEPTANCE IS EXPRESSLY LIMITED TO THESE TERMS.

    1. ACCESS GRANT. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, H2O hereby grants User a non-sublicensable, non-transferable, nonexclusive right to access and use (on a remote software-as-a-service basis) the Solution only for User’s internal use for the purpose for which the Solution is provided. If provided for trial use, or otherwise on a free basis, the Solution will only be used by User to help internally evaluate whether User wants to enter a commercial agreement with H2O for the Solution. User’s use will only be in accordance with any H2O-provided documentation (including as provided electronically) (“Documentation”). If any software is provided hereunder, User will have a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to internally use the software (in object code form only), solely as necessary to help use the Solution. Any such software will be subject to the restrictions, disclaimers, and limitations as the Solution herein. No copies of software will be made (except one copy may be made for back-up purposes only). The Solution may be accessed by the number of users agreed to by H2O and User in an Order Document. If applicable, such users will be specific individuals named by User during the purchase process, or subsequently, in writing (email is sufficient). Once such named individuals are selected by User, they may be changed only on written notice to H2O (email is sufficient). The named individuals will not allow any other User personnel to use their Solution log-in credentials (passwords, etc.). No source code will be provided. With respect to any User proposed modifications, derivatives, enhancements or improvements to the Solution (for clarity, including any software that may be provided hereunder) (“Feedback”), User hereby grants H2O a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free, fully paid-up, sub-licensable, right and license to use, display, reproduce, distribute and otherwise fully exploit such Feedback for any purposes. All Feedback is provided by User “AS IS.”
    2. RESTRICTIONS. Except as expressly and unambiguously permitted by this Agreement, User shall not, nor permit anyone else to, directly or indirectly: (i) copy, modify, resell, or distribute the Solution; (ii) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or structure, sequence and organization of the Solution (except the foregoing will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable local law); (iii) rent, lease, or use the Solution for timesharing or service bureau purposes, or otherwise use the Solution on behalf of any third party; (iv) use the Solution to develop any other product or service, or (v) use the Solution for performing comparisons or other "benchmarking" activities, either alone or in connection with any other Solution (and User will not publish or disclose any such performance information or comparisons). User shall maintain and not remove or obscure any proprietary notices on or in the Solution. As between the parties, title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in and to the Solution, and any copies or portions thereof, shall remain in H2O and its suppliers or H2O’s. The Solution is protected by the copyright laws and treaties. This Agreement does not give User any rights not expressly granted herein.  On ten (10) days’ notice, H2O shall have the right to (itself or through a designated third party) audit User’s facilities, networks, systems, books and records to confirm User’s use of the Solution is in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. User will fully cooperate and assist with such audits.
    3. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Each party agrees that all code, know-how, business, technical and financial information it obtains (“Receiving Party”) from the disclosing party (“Disclosing Party”) constitutes the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (“Confidential Information”), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be Confidential Information due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure.  Any performance information relating to the Solution (for clarity, including any software), and the terms and conditions of this Agreement, shall be deemed Confidential Information of H2O without any marking or further designation.  In addition, all fees and pricing information will be H2O’s Confidential Information. Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Confidential Information.  The Receiving Party’s nondisclosure obligation shall not apply to information which the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (ii) is or has become generally available to the public through no fault of the Receiving Party; (iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information. In addition, the Receiving Party may disclose information as required to be disclosed pursuant to a regulation, law or court order (but only to the minimum extent required to comply with such regulation or order and with advance notice to the Disclosing Party).  The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.
    4. SUPPORT. During the term of this Agreement H2O will provide User with Solution support according to H2O’s general support practices and procedures (including its fix queues and release cycles). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Solution is provided on a trial basis, or otherwise for free, any support provided is in H2O’s sole discretion.
    5. FEES. User shall pay H2O the fees (if any) for the Solution as agreed to by the parties in an Order Document. Such fees are payable within thirty (30) days from the date of invoice. Except as expressly set forth herein, all fees are non-refundable and non-cancellable. If this Agreement is terminated for H2O’s uncured breach, H2O will refund to User all fees paid in advance for the remainder of the term.  Fees are payable in US dollars.  User shall also pay all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, tariffs and duties of any type assessed against H2O except for taxes on H2O’s income.  Late fees will be subject to a finance charge of the lesser of (i) 1.5% per thirty (30) day period and (ii) the greatest amount allowed by applicable law. User will also reimburse H2O for all costs of collection (including attorneys’ fees). To the extent the Solution is procured via a reseller – and User pays such reseller for the Solution – User will not owe fees directly to H2O hereunder.
    6. INDEMNITY. H2O will indemnify and hold User harmless from and against all third-party claims (and all resulting, to the extent payable to unaffiliated third parties: damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from the infringement, or alleged infringement, of any third party intellectual property rights by the Solution. H2O’s indemnity obligations are contingent on User providing H2O with prompt written notice of all claims and threats thereof, sole control of all defense and settlement activities, and all reasonably requested assistance with respect thereto. In the event a claim arises, or in H2O’s sole determination may arise, H2O may, at its election: (i) modify the Solution so it no longer infringes, (ii) secure necessary licenses for User to allow continued, non-infringing use, or (iii) terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days written notice. In the event of (iii), H2O will refund to User all fees paid in advance for the remainder of the term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, H2O will have no indemnity obligations if the Solution is provided on a trial basis or otherwise for free. User shall indemnify and hold harmless H2O from any claims, damages, liabilities, costs and fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from User’s use of the Solution as well as from User’s negligence, willful misconduct or failure to comply with any term of this Agreement.
    7. WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER.  H2O warrants to User that the Solution will conform materially with the Documentation.  In the event of a breach of this Section, User’s sole remedy, and H2O’s exclusive liability, shall be for H2O to use commercially reasonable efforts to correct any such defect(s); provided that, User specifically notifies H2O in writing of the defect(s) within thirty (30) days from the date User first experiences the defect. Such corrections will be in accordance with H2O’s standard practices (such as release cycles) that it provides to its other general customers. The warranty above will not apply if the Solution is provided on a trial basis (or otherwise for free). EXCEPT AS SET FORTH ABOVE, THE SOLUTION IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND H2O HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT.
    8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, TORT, CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL H2O OR ITS SUPPLIERS OR RESELLERS BE LIABLE TO USER OR ANY OTHER PERSON IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOLUTION OR ANY OTHER SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY: (I) INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, (II) ANY AMOUNTS, IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF THE FEES PAID TO H2O HEREUNDER DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE DATE THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES (BUT, IF NO AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN PAID, SUCH CAP WILL BE US$100.00), (III) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE SOLUTION, OR (IV) MATTERS BEYOND H2O’S REASONABLE CONTROL. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY EVEN IF H2O SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    9. TRIAL USE DATA. If the Solution is provided on a trial basis, User will only load into the Solution, or otherwise process via the Solution, non-sensitive, test data. User acknowledges that H2O makes no representations, warranties, guarantees, or covenants with respect to information security. It is User’s sole responsibility to ensure that the data it provides is not of a sensitive or otherwise valuable nature.
    10. TERM AND TERMINATION. This Agreement is effective as of the date it is accepted by User (“Effective Date”) and will have the term agreed to by the parties in an Order Document. Thereafter, this Agreement and the Order Document will automatically renew for consecutive periods of equal length to the initial term unless either party provides the other party with written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term. If no term is designated in an Order Document, this Agreement will have a term of one (1) year from the Effective Date (but if the Solution is provided on a trial basis, or otherwise for free, the initial term will be thirty (30) days and will not automatically renew). Either party may terminate this Agreement if the other party breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days from receipt of written notice thereof (provided that, such notice provides sufficient detail regarding the breach and expressly states the intent to terminate). If the Solution is provided on a trial basis, or otherwise for free, either party may terminate this Agreement on five (5) days written notice (for convenience). Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, User shall immediately cease use of the Solution (and return to H2O all H2O-provided documentation and materials, if any). On termination, each party will promptly return to the other party all of such other party’s Confidential Information (or, at the disclosing party’s request, destroy such information), including all copies and extracts thereof. Sections 3 and 5 through 14, as well as all license and use restrictions, shall survive termination of this Agreement.
    11. EXPORT CONTROLS. User shall comply with all export laws and restrictions and regulations of the Department of Commerce, the United States Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), or other United States or foreign agency or authority, and User shall not export, or allow the export or re-export of the Solution in violation of any such restrictions, laws or regulations. By installing or using the Solution, User agrees to the foregoing and represents and warrants that User is not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any restricted country.
    12. NOTICE. Any notice or communication required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing to the parties at: (i) if to User, the address listed by User during the Solution registration process (or as otherwise provided by User; but if none is provided, such address will the address H2O reasonably identifies), (ii) if to H2O, Attn: Legal (or at such other address as may be given by H2O at any time) - and shall be deemed to have been received by the addressee, (iii) if given by hand, immediately upon receipt, (iv) if given by overnight courier service, the first business day following dispatch or (v) if given by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, the second business day after such notice is deposited in the mail. In addition, to be effective, legal notices to H2O (such as for breach) must also be provided in email to: legal@h2o.ai (subject heading: Attn: Legal Notice) (but, notwithstanding earlier receipt via email, legal notices will be deemed received when the physical notice is received as set forth in the preceding sentence). Notwithstanding the foregoing, an electronic notice to User (such as via email) is sufficient to the extent related to breach or termination.
    13. LOGO USAGE. During the term of this Agreement and for a reasonable wind-down period thereafter, H2O may use User’s name and logo on its website and in marketing materials as part of a general list of customers.
    14. MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement represents the complete agreement concerning the Solution between the parties, to the exclusion of any pre-printed or contrary terms of any User purchase order (or similar document) (even if accepted or performed on by H2O), and supersedes all prior agreements and representations between them; provided, however, that if there is already a mutually-signed agreement between H2O and User (not including any User purchase order or similar document) covering User’s purchase of a license to use the Solution, then the express terms of that signed agreement will govern to the extent they are expressly contrary to this Agreement. This Agreement may be amended only by a writing executed by both parties. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. The failure of H2O to act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by User or others does not constitute a waiver and shall not limit H2O’s rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches. This Agreement is personal to User and may not be assigned or transferred for any reason whatsoever without H2O’s consent and any action or conduct in violation of the foregoing shall be void and without effect. H2O expressly reserves the right to assign this Agreement and to delegate any of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under California law as such law applies to agreements between California residents entered into and to be performed within California, without regard to the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act.  Without limiting Company’s right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in court, either party may elect (by written notice given prior to filing a complaint or, in the case of the defendant, prior to answering a complaint) to resolve a dispute by binding arbitration in the English language in San Francisco, California under the Rules and Procedures of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. (“JAMS”); the decision of the arbitrator will be enforceable in any court.  The JAMS Streamlined Rules will be used if available. Subject to the foregoing, all disputes will be subject to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California. The party prevailing in any dispute under this Agreement shall be entitled to its costs and legal fees.
